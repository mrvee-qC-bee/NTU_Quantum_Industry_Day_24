## Instructions for editing Qiskit 101 slides

The Qiskit 101 slides are stored as a PowerPoint file. Since Linux doesn't have good support for PowerPoint, we use these steps to upload changes:

1. Access the file on Box at <https://ibm.box.com/s/ytrsz2g7225p24d8me5ksg4g1ps24vpc>
2. Request edit access from Kevin Sung (@kevinsung, <kevinsung@ibm.com>)
3. Edit the file on Box using Microsoft PowerPoint Online.
4. Download the updated file and add it to git.
